- Type sof Inline assembly vode
    1. Basic Inline assembly code
        Format: asm ("Statemnts)
    2. Extended Inline Assembly code
        Format: asm ("statements" : ouput_registers : input_registers : clobbered_registers)
- Volatile specifier instructs the compiler not to modify the statement and place it exactly where it was in the orginal code
- Modifier (For output value)
    = (tells the compiler that the previous value will be discarded and replaced by the new data)
    + (And operand i read and written by an instruction)
    & (Output register shouldn't ovelap an inout register and sgould be used only for output)
    % (Tells the compiler that operans may be commutative)
- Qualifier 
    r -> means a value will be stored in one of the general purpose register
- Constraints
    Any number from 0 to 9 is called the matching contraint
